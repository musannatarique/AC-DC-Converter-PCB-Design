# Simple AC to DC Converter PCB – Kathbadam PCB

This project is a simple AC to DC converter circuit designed as a compact and easy-to-assemble PCB. It uses a full-wave bridge rectifier followed by a smoothing capacitor and an LED indicator for visual confirmation of DC output.

## Features

- Full-wave bridge rectifier using 1N4007 diodes  
- 1000µF filtering capacitor for voltage smoothing  
- LED indicator for DC output status  
- Screw terminals for easy input/output connections  
- Designed for low-voltage AC input (recommended: 6V–24V AC)

## Components Used

- **Diodes (D1–D4):** 1N4007  
- **Capacitor (C1):** 1000µF, 25V  
- **Resistors:**  
  - R1: 10kΩ  
  - R2: 2.2kΩ (LED current limiting)  
- **LED (D5):** Standard 5mm LED  
- **Terminals:** 2× Screw Terminal Blocks for AC input and DC output  

## Input & Output

- **Input (J1):** AC Voltage (VC IN)
- **Output (J2):** Rectified DC (DC OUT)

## Notes

- This PCB is intended for **low-voltage AC** applications.  
- Ensure proper orientation of polarized components (diodes, capacitor, LED).  
- For higher current loads, increase trace width and ensure component ratings are suitable.
